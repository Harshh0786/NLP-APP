# NLP Application for Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Prediction
October 2023 - December 2023

## Summary:
Architected, developed, and deployed a comprehensive NLP application that harnessed ParallelDots API for named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and emotion prediction. Leveraged Python, NLTK, ParallelDots API, and Streamlit to empower users with advanced text analysis. Additionally, designed a secure login and registration GUI using the Tkinter library, backed by JSON-based data storage.

## Accomplishments:

Integrated ParallelDots API to seamlessly perform named entity recognition, extracting essential information like names, dates, locations, and organizations.
Incorporated sentiment analysis capabilities using the ParallelDots API, enabling users to comprehend the sentiment expressed in input text.
Employed machine learning models from ParallelDots API to predict emotions, enhancing the application's ability to discern emotional nuances within text data.
Crafted a user-friendly login and registration graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, offering secure access to the application's features.
Utilized JSON as a database to store user registration details, creating an efficient and lightweight data management solution.
Collaborated with users to refine the GUI design and ensure intuitive navigation, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Skills Demonstrated:

Advanced integration of ParallelDots API for named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and emotion prediction.
Proficiency in Python programming, NLTK library, and Streamlit framework for sophisticated NLP applications.
Development of secure login and registration GUI using Tkinter, facilitating user authentication and interaction.
Utilization of JSON-based data storage for efficient management of user registration details.
Effective communication and feedback incorporation to optimize GUI usability and features.

## Impact:
The NLP application, empowered by ParallelDots API, offered users a robust toolkit for extracting insights from text data, including entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and emotion prediction. The secure login and registration GUI enhanced user engagement and data privacy, while JSON-based data storage streamlined information management. This project exemplified my ability to merge diverse technologies into a cohesive application, delivering an invaluable resource for text analysis while prioritizing user security and experience.
